*When to use #420 Fast Catalyst - Use this catalyst in situations where fast dry times for your prime coat are required.  This is the <strong>ONLY</strong> Klass Kote epoxy catalyst component we sell that <strong><u>does not require</u></strong> an induction (waiting) period after mixing - before applying.
With Primer Catalyst White Fast #420, you mix it thoroughly with the side-A component, reduce it with Epoxy Reducer #500, then immediately strain it into your spray equipment or brush it on right away - no waiting.  With other Klass Kote Epoxy catalysts - you need to let the mixture sit (induct) for a minimum of 30 minutes before reducing it and applying. <a href=""https://www.storesonlinepro.com/files/3863370/uploaded/KlassKotePrimerDataSheet-2014.pdf"" target=""_blank""> Read Primer Data sheet</a> for other difference between Reg and Fast Catalyst. Sizes...
